Argument	Description

-torrent	Path to a .torrent file to download repeatedly

-file	URL to a file to download repeatedly

-p	SOCKS5 proxy in ip:port format or path to a .txt file with proxies

  If no arguments are provided, the script will prompt you interactively.

## üìé Behavior

   If downloading torrents, the .torrent file is reused indefinitely.

   If downloading files, 2 threads are used by default (configurable).

   Downloaded files are deleted after completion.

   Proxy selection is randomized per download.

  On error or failure, the script retries up to 99 times before giving up.

## üí° Tips

  To use with TOR, run:

    python ddot.py -file http://example.com/file -p 127.0.0.1:9050

  Use a proxy list (one ip:port per line) for auto-rotation.
